                Innovative swimming pool system , traditional system of filtration or liner compact filters are not
                able to solve turbidity problem in pools quickly and coagulant dose is necessary, plus chlorine dose
                and filtration itself sometimes not effective in complete removal of virus and bacteria.
                Now high flux ultra-filters swimming pool system available. it is PLC controlled with touch screen,
                has the advantages of continuous chlorine and pH control for the pool water and high quality
                filtered water and complete removal of turbidity micro organisms with its unique pore size o.1
                micron . the system is smart full automatic system.
